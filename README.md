## Understanding the impact of growth rates and margin on B2B SaaS valuations

**TL;DR**
    
For high-growth B2B SaaS companies:

* **Growth drives revenue multiples**
  * Higher growth &#8594 Premium revenue multiples
  * Lower growth &#8594 Discounted revenue multiples
         
* **Gross Margin doesn't impact valuation**
  * All things being equal, companies with higher gross margins don't command higher revenue multiples
  * And conversely, lower gross margins don't seem to pull down revenue multiples
